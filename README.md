# WELCOME TO MACGYVER MAZE GAME

**THE GAME**  
You are MacGyver, trapped in a maze. The exit is watched by a gard. To escape, you must first pick up 3 objects in the maze: a needle, a small tube and some ether. With them, you'll make a syringe to drug the guard and run away. But if you try to escape without the syringe, the guard will kill you !

**HOW TO PLAY**  
Move MacGyver with the direction keys: up, down, left, right.  
To pick up the objects, simply put MacGyver on their place.  
The 3 objects will automatically transform into a syringe once you have picked up all of them.  
Once you have the syringe, all you have to do is rush to the exit.
