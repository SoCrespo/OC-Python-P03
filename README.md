**WELCOME TO MACGYVER MAZE GAME!**

**THE GAME**  
You are MacGyver, trapped in a maze. The exit is watched by a gard. To escape, you must first pick up 3 objects in the maze : a needle, a small tube and some ether. With them, you'll make a syringe to drug the gard and flee.

**HOW TO PLAY**  
Move MacGyver through the maze with the direction keys : up, down, left, right.   
To pick up the objects, simply put MacGyver on their place.   
The 3 objects will automatically transform into a syringe once you have picked up all of them.   
Once you got the syringe, all you have to do is rush to the exit.

Beware : if you reach the exit without the syringe, the gard will kill you !

**SETUP**  
Todo

**CONFIG**  
The maze pattern is in the pattern.txt file an can be modified.   
It is a 15 x 15 structure, in which each cell is represented by a specific character :  
" W " (uppercase)for a piece of wall     
" _ " (key 8 of the keyboard) for a piece of corridor  
" : " for the exit.

*About the exit, please note :*
- the maze must be entirely closed with walls, except for one, and only one, exit.
- DO NOT locate the exit in a corner, since MacGyver cannot move in diagonal.

Here is an example of how to represent a small structure of 3 x 3 cells, the exit is in the east wall:
